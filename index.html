      "My education paved the way to my destination of achievement. Growing up in a small town in India, I never dreamed that I would some day lead technology for a Fortune 500 global technology corporation.  Well, dreams don’t bring success; hard work, dedication and perseverance do. Now it’s my time to give the gift of education to those in need. I am deeply grateful to the ASSOCHAM Ladies League in Technology Innovation, for partnering with me to help someone deserving to reach new pinnacles of success."

			<hr>
			<p>In March 2014, the ASSOCHAM Ladies League in Technology Innovation honored Padmasree with the “Hyderabad Woman of the Decade” award.  As part of the award, Rai University instituted the “Padmasree Warrior University Scholarship” for an underprivileged girl nominated by Padmasree every year.
